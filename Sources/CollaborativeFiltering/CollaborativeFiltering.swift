/// Collaborative filtering is a type of recommendation algorithm that utilizes the preferences and behavior of similar
/// users to suggest items that a user may like. It works by finding patterns in the preferences of different users and
/// using these patterns to predict the preferences of new users.
///
/// Collaborative filtering can be used in a variety of applications such as recommending movies, music, or products
/// ("items") to customers ("users"). The algorithm is based on the assumption that people who have similar preferences
/// in the past will have similar preferences in the future.
///
/// The algorithm can also be applied to single-user use cases where you aim to predict future behavior based on past
/// behavior. In scenarios like this, users can instead represent distinct user sessions.
///
